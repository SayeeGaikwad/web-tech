        <p>Manali is named after Manu, the progenitor of humanity in Hinduism. 
            The name Manali is regarded as the derivative of Manu-Alaya (transl.â€‰'the 
            abode of Manu').[4] In Hindu cosmology, Manu is believed to have stepped 
            off his ark in Manali to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged 
            the world at the end of an cyclic age.</p>
